# Deep-Data-Analysis
This software is designed to both allow people not familiar with coding or machine learning as well as for professionals in these fields to easily design and apply neural networks and data processing functions for extracting data from images, videos or data in any other format.
This is a community based project similar to GIMP and Mozilla and, therefore, the software is made by users and for users.
